- All pages will be stored in the [src/app/pages](src/app/pages) folder - always create via `ng g page pages/page-name`
- After creating the page, double check [app.routes.ts](src/app/app.routes.ts) that the correct path is set.
- In [app.component.ts](src/app/app.component.ts) add a new absolute path to the new page
- Make other changes in the page you created.
- Everything is suggested on iPad Pro 11 (in Google Chrome Dev Tools)
